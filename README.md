## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an AI Research Scientist with over 15 years of experience in industry and academia. I leverage my background in physics, biology, and computational methods to develop AI-driven solutions for complex biological challenges. My expertise spans statistical modeling, multi-omics analysis, and machine learning applications in human health, longevity, and drug discovery.

My personal mission is to enable healthy lifespans of up to 200 years through breakthroughs in Bio-MLâ€”contributing innovations that benefit all of humanity. Outside of work, Iâ€™m a lifelong swimmer and avid runner.
